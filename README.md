# ReverseBot

A Twitter Bot that replies to all tweets of a specified person with their original tweet, but rotated 180 degrees. 

- Uses [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) to interact with Twitter's API using python. 
- Uses [upsidedown](https://pypi.org/project/upsidedown/) to flip/reverse the text.

## Config

Insert keys, tokens and account ids to follow in the 'config.json' file. Replace all info with the placeholder string.

### __NOTE: Must include your own keys and tokens__

## Account IDS

Use [TweeterID](https://tweeterid.com/) to convert twitter handles into account ids that the bot can read.
